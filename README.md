# PySOE v0.02b
Python Simulated Operating System Environment or PySOE is a closed sandbox environment that runs inside *any* Python Interpreter. It's main purpose is to run it's own small ecosystem of apps specifically created for it.

//You probably shouldn't be here//

//Unless you're developing apps//

//Then you can stay//

Yes, you can infact sell this. Or take the source code and turn it into your own program with minimal work. 

I don't care that much. It's a BSD license, do what you want.

# How do i use this?

1. Create a directory (Preferably on desktop for easy access)
2. Install Programs you want to use from either Applications-Dev or Applications-Stable into the same directory with Shell, Login, and Main files.
3. Use your Python Interpreter to open main.py
